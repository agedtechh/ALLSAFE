SO far
I was having lots of trouble getting hugo to properly run. I was using the flatpak from the LM Software Manager, and then I tried using:">

<p>I was having <strong>lots</strong> of trouble getting hugo to properly run. I was using the flatpak from the LM Software Manager, and then I tried using:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install hugo</code></p>
<p>But I kept running into various errors and issues. My mistake was running old versions of hugo. Then I grabbed the latest extended <code>.deb</code> from github. At this point I had probably created and deleted 5 to 6 different test sites and hugo installations.</p>
<p>I also went on a tangent to find a text editor and chose Pulsar since it is a fork of the deeply loved, archived Atom. Getting that setup using the flatpak in the SM was easy. I had another set of issues though since I wanted to be able to launch and open files in Pulsar using terminal commands. The hugo quick start mentions that Pulsar commands are automatically installed on Linux, but the only Pulsar commands I am finding are linked to something called ODIN? I am looking for a way to stream line my process. Maybe I can get Pulsar to start up on boot.</p>
<p>Done! Just had to find Startup apps using search func.</p>

# Themes

I am going to try to change the theme. I will do this with no docs. If I break something, or can't get it to work, I might just have to delete this site and start fresh. If I start fresh, the previous posts will not be reuploaded. I will just consolidate them into one summarizing post, showing my failures, when I create my actual blog.

## Tangent
Speaking of said blog. I'm not sure whether to make it just my name or do the whole Agedtech thing? I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get there. I'll tackle more of this subject once I get to my WHY I WANT A BLOG in 2025 post.

# Themes.2
First I will find a theme, follow the instructions for install. echo the theme name into the hugo.toml file and then try to push to github.

## Results:

So yeah, didn't work. I tried using [poison](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/) and the damn site kept breaking during deployment at the Build with Hugo stage. I should have taken a picture or at least copied the error. I might try again with this theme tomorrow. I'm not sure what was going wrong. It seemed like it wasn't able to locate the theme based on the path, but I tried updating my theme in the hugo.toml file, as well as the config.toml file that was in the themes folder. Still no shot. It kept failing. I'll try again tomorrow.

Also, I keep forgetting to mark posts as `draft = false`.

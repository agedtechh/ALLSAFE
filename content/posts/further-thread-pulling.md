# Themes

I am going to try to change the theme. I will do this with no docs. If I break something, or can't get it to work, I might just have to delete this site and start fresh. If I start fresh, the previous posts will not be reuploaded. I will just consolidate them into one summarizing post, showing my failures, when I create my actual blog.

## Tangent
Speaking of said blog. I'm not sure whether to make it just my name or do the whole Agedtech thing? I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get there. I'll tackle more of this subject once I get to my WHY I WANT A BLOG in 2025 post.

# Themes.2
First I will find a theme, follow the instructions for install. echo the theme name into the hugo.toml file and then try to push to github.

# GIT it?
I am trying to see if I can get a better grasp on the `git` commands needed to push new adjustments to my github account.

## GIT This?

What I will try is the following:

`git add .`
`git push origin main`
`git commit -m "Second thread"`

OOOH, okay. ran the commands in the order above. nothing changed. When running `git push` I would get a message stating everything is up to date. My site didn't change. Neither did my repo. But, I switched the last two commands and ran them in this order:

`git add .`
`git commit -m "MESSAGE"`
`git push origin main`

Lets see how this WORKS!

IT WORKED! Just had to wait a bit for the repo to update and refresh the link!!

*EDIT: Use `github add -A` instead of `git add .`.

Used [this link](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) to deploy my site on github.*
